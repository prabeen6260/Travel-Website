<h2 class="section-title">The Journey Begins: Lukla to Namche Bazaar</h2>
<p>The Everest Base Camp trek usually starts with an exhilarating flight to Lukla, one of the most thrilling airports in the world. From here, the trek begins with a relatively easy hike through dense forests, crossing suspension bridges draped with prayer flags and passing by small villages that give you a glimpse of traditional Sherpa culture.</p>

<p>After a few days, you’ll reach Namche Bazaar, the Sherpa capital and the main acclimatization point. Nestled in the lap of towering peaks, Namche is a vibrant town full of trekkers, shops, and teahouses. Here, you'll get your first stunning views of Everest and begin to feel the altitude.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Embracing the Challenges: Tengboche to Dingboche</h2>
<p>As you ascend higher, the air becomes thinner and the terrain more rugged. From Namche, the trek continues to Tengboche Monastery, one of the most important spiritual centers in the region, where trekkers can experience a sense of serenity with panoramic mountain views. The path then leads to Dingboche, where trekkers often take another acclimatization day to prepare for the final ascent.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Reaching New Heights: Lobuche to Everest Base Camp</h2>
<p>From Lobuche to Gorak Shep, the landscape turns barren and rocky, but the proximity to Everest keeps spirits high. Finally, you’ll reach Everest Base Camp (5,364 meters), standing in the shadow of the towering Khumbu Icefall. This is the closest most trekkers get to Everest, and the sense of achievement is overwhelming.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <h2 class="section-title">Sunrise at Kala Patthar</h2>
    <p>The final challenge for most trekkers is the early morning hike up Kala Patthar (5,545 meters) for a panoramic view of Mount Everest and its neighboring peaks at sunrise. Watching the sun's first rays hit the world’s tallest mountain is a moment that will stay with you forever.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Descent</h2>
<p>After reaching Base Camp and Kala Patthar, the trek back down to Lukla begins. While the descent is physically easier, it offers plenty of opportunities to reflect on the journey, revisit friendly teahouses, and take in the views you may have missed on the way up.</p>
